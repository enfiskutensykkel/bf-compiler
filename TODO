Reintroduce the load/store semantics in the tokens
    - it is benificial when you do addb/subb more than 127 times
    - movb + addb + movb *may* be more efficient than addb on memory address
Implement proper word-sized addw and subw for moving the cell pointer around (right now it's only up to 127 times)
Optimise away (in parser) redundant '+' and '-' (for example ++++--+ = +++ = addb 3)
Optimise away (in parser) redundant '<' and '>'
Make output buffer (that can be disabled with compiler flag)
Optimise away uncessessary loops (comment loops) where the cell value is known to be zero
